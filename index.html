          It Happens Here is currently raising money for <c class="bold">Street Ransom</c> in Roanoke, Virginia! Our goal is to raise $5,000 which will furnish all 7 rooms in the safe home.
          Initially, our goal was to raise $700, but we reached that goal in the first 6 hours!
          <br />
          We need your help, so we came up with a little incentive to get you involved.  
          You get to decide what happens to Jordan White's hair for his college graduation!
          <br />
          <br />
          Your four voting options are: <br />
          • Dread It <br />
          • Buzz It <br />
          • Grow It<br />
          • Fro It <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Again, this will be Jordan's hairstyle for his COLLEGE GRADUATION! <br />
          Every dollar is a vote! (there's a $3 minimum to vote) <br />
          The campaign ends this <c class="bold">Sunday April 23rd</c>.<br />
